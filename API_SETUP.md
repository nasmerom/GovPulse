# How to Add Your Congress.gov API Key

1. Open the file '.env.local' in your project root
2. Replace 'your_congress_api_key_here' with your actual API key
3. Save the file
4. Restart your development server

Example:
CONGRESS_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789

Your API key will be automatically used by the Congress page and other features that fetch real congressional data.

If you don't have an API key yet, get one at: https://api.congress.gov/
